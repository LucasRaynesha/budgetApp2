Spring Boot Application
=
Budget Tracker System
-

This application allows you to record your transactions and monthly budget. The application allows users to add , delete, and edit transactions and budgets.
The web app also includes a section for a budget where the user can set the amount. When inserting a transaction the user can include everything about the transaction.
Building this application was challenging with creating the design. Some feauture that I would like to include in the future are all a graph that tracks the expenses
